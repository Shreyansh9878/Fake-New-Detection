Is the Signal chat leak involving Trump officials a big deal?
News comes
out of Trumpâs White House at such a relentless pace that stories can seemingly vanish into the background, steamrolled by the presidentâs latest Truth post or
executive order.
But Signalgate,
as this scandal has been dubbed, is the rare story with staying power.
When Trump announced a
new tariff
in the Oval Office this afternoon, he told a reporter who asked about Signal to âhold on one secondâ so he could find someone else who would ask him about tariffs.
Trump did end up taking questions on the Signal group chat, and the president distanced himself from the scandal. Asked if he was sure no classified material was shared, he said âthatâs what Iâve heard. I donât knowâ.
It's a scaled back take, compared to what many in his administration said today - they've been adamant that no classified materials were shared.
